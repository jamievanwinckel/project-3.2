    <!--What's different about the real blackjack game compared to mine:
      - ace only equals 11
      - not real cards show up
      - only one person can play at a time-->

        <p>
          Your goal is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a count of 21,
          if you do go over 21 you bust. You want to beat the dealer, and all of your cards
          are added up into a sum. You press 'hit me' when you want another card,
          and you press 'no more cards' when you want to stop. You should stand
          if the dealers first card was a 4, 5 or 6. But if the dealers first card
          is a 2 or 3, take a hit and stop at a total of 13 or more.
